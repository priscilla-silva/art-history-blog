           <h3>About</h3>
           My name is Priscilla Silva. I'm 29 years old and I have
           a Bachelor's degree in Art History from the University of
           California–Davis. I started this blog to cope with the fact 
           that I can't use my art history degree for anything other 
           than making fun of the subject itself. 
           <br>
           If I shall starve, at least I'll have fun with it!
