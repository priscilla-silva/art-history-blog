            <h3>Madonna With a(n Ugly) Child</h3>
            <br>
            There’s this idea of art being the sublime and the divine. From 
            beautiful landscapes to blushing Virgins surrounded by a swarm of 
            bubbly cherubs, art is perhaps the closest we have ever gotten to 
            God—whatever that is. The idea becomes more prevalent when we look 
            at sacred art, particularly to the depictions of the Madonna and Child. 
            Because what could be more heart-warming than a mother holding her baby?

            <br>
            <p>The theme of the Madonna and Child has been present in art since its inception. 
            Being the church the most powerful institution, both ideologically and economically, 
            it is no surprise the first works of art were commissioned by the church. The 
            result were the often cheesy and repetitive Biblical scenes we know so well. 
            You know, the Crucifixion, the Last Supper, the Lamentation, and of course, the 
            Madonna and Child.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><h4>Ugly, sad babies</h4>
            I’m not particularly fond of children. I don’t find them cute and I certainly 
            do not enjoy their company. Of course, this is an unpopular opinion, as most 
            people love children.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p><h4>But wait, I thought Madonna was a singer...</h4>
                The name “Madonna” in Italian means “My Lady”. In a religious context, 
                it’s another way to refer to Virgin Mary, kinda like a nobility title. But yes, 
                Madonna is also the singer who brought us works of art like “Vogue”, 
                “Like a Prayer”, “La Isla Bonita”, etc.

            <h3>Jesus in da Haus (of Levi)</h3>
            <br>
            In the year of 1573, roughly three months after Italian artist Paolo Veronese had finished 
            this piece, the Holy Tribunal summoned the artist on the account of his painting to answer 
            questions about elements deemed inappropriate for a depiction of the Last Supper.           
        </p>
        <br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feast_in_the_House_of_Levi#/media/File:The_Feast_in_the_House_of_Levi_(edited).jpg"><img src="/images/The_Feast_in_the_House_of_Levi_(edited).jpeg" alt="The Feast in the House of Levi
        by Paolo Veronese" width="900px" height="400px"></a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the Renaissance, it was uncommon for patrons to give any specifications in regards to 
            how a story or scene was portrayed by the artist.Given that it was common practice for 
            the artist to create their own composition with only a subject matter to guide them from the 
            patron, the Holy Tribunal, unsurprisingly, put the artist Veronese on trial, and not the patron.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            During the interrogation, Veronese was asked to explain why the painting contained "buffoons, 
            drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities" as well as extravagant costumes and 
            settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast. Veronese defended 
            his painting by claiming that this painting had a large amount of space for him to fill; thus, 
            on a practical level, he had to fill in any superfluous space left over which is why he included 
            these figures. The artist also stated that he felt the placement of these figures was a good 
            distance away from Christ, keeping them from tainting the image of the Last Supper.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> By painting The Feast in the House of Levi in this manner, Veronese had gone against the Council of Trent, 
            which had been created as part of the Counter-Reformation. The Council of Trent included the invention 
            of very strict rules that religious artworks must adhere to. To prevent any type of interference to 
            the righteous message of artworks, the Council of Trent mandated that all religious artworks must refrain 
            from any type of purely decorative or aesthetic additions in artworks. According to the transcript of 
            the trial of Veronese for The Feast in the House of Levi, the artist clearly stated that he had filled 
            the extra space with figures in order to create a full and complete composition. However, the manner in 
            which this was accomplished was in direct violation of the Council of Trent's rules. The artist's 
            reasoning did not move the Holy Tribunal. The Holy Tribunal made clear to Veronese that, in their opinion, 
            he had opened Catholicism up to censure from Protestants and must fix his mistake. </p>
            <br>
        <p> In the end, Veronese was told by the Holy Tribunal that he must change his painting within a three-month period. 
            Instead, he simply changed the title to The Feast in the House of Levi, still an episode from the Gospels, 
            but less doctrinally central, and one in which the Gospels specified "sinners" as present. Veronese decided to 
            add an inscription to the painting as well, thereby removing the association to Simon and instead linking 
            the artwork to Levi.</p>
