            <h3>Madonna With a(n Ugly) Child</h3>
            There’s this idea of art being the sublime and the divine. From 
            beautiful landscapes to blushing Virgins surrounded by a swarm of 
            bubbly cherubs, art is perhaps the closest we have ever gotten to 
            God—whatever that is. The idea becomes more prevalent when we look 
            at sacred art, particularly to the depictions of the Madonna and Child. 
            Because what could be more heart-warming than a mother holding her baby?

            <p>The theme of the Madonna and Child has been present in art since its inception. 
            Being the church the most powerful institution, both ideologically and economically, 
            it is no surprise the first works of art were commissioned by the church. The 
            result were the often cheesy and repetitive Biblical scenes we know so well. 
            You know, the Crucifixion, the Last Supper, the Lamentation, and of course, the 
            Madonna and Child.</p>
            <p><h4>Ugly, sad babies</h4>
            I’m not particularly fond of children. I don’t find them cute and I certainly 
            do not enjoy their company. Of course, this is an unpopular opinion, as most 
            people love children.

            <p><h4>But wait, I thought Madonna was a singer...</h4>
                The name “Madonna” in Italian means “My Lady”. In a religious context, 
                it’s another way to refer to Virgin Mary, kinda like a nobility title. But yes, 
                Madonna is also the singer who brought us works of art like “Vogue”, 
                “Like a Prayer”, “La Isla Bonita”, etc.
